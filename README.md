# Bone Edge Detection and Contour Overlay

This project performs edge detection and contour overlay on bone images using MATLAB. The process includes Gaussian filtering, Sobel edge detection, Hough transform, and active contour segmentation.

## Project Details

- **Filtering**: Gaussian filter is applied to smooth the image.
- **Edge Detection**: Sobel edge detection method is used, followed by morphological operations to close the edges.
- **Hough Transform**: The Hough transform is used to detect specific angles in edge-detected images.
- **Active Contour Segmentation**: The Chan-Vese method is used to segment the bone regions.
